## Hashing

You will create a C++ program to calculate the frequency of each string in a given list of
strings. For this lab, you can use the built-in unordered map or ordered map template to
implement your solution.

### Input Files

● The first line will be an integer, representing the number of words given

● The second line will contain multiple strings, separated by a space

● No empty lines, special characters, or blank file

● Remove \n and \r before processing the input line if needed

### Output Files
● Output the frequency associated with the string in alphabetical order
